# TicTacToe Game in Python with Pygame

Welcome to the TicTacToe game documentation! This TicTacToe game is a simple implementation in Python using the Pygame library.

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic TicTacToe game. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all spaces are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
